# iOSTraitCollectionThemingExample

This is a super simple example application meant to be used in tandem with my blog post on theming iOS apps using `UITraitCollection` (so please read that first if you haven't yet!).

## Building

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `ThemingExample.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a device or simulator.
4. If everything compiles (which it should!) you should get an app with a single button. Tapping the button changes the theme. It's as simple as that. Here's an recording of it in action:
